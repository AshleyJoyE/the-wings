## Our Project:
Welcome to Oink, where financial empowerment meets accessibility. We believe that everyone deserves the tools and knowledge to manage their finances effectively, regardless of their background or income level.

Our mission is to provide individuals with free access to essential financial services because we understand the importance of financial stability and independence in achieving personal goals and building a secure future.

Moreover, we're also about education and empowerment. We recognize the value of early financial education, which is why Oink serves as a learning ground for high school students and individuals of all ages to start their journey towards financial literacy.

Whether you're a recent graduate navigating your first paycheck, a family striving to make ends meet, or someone planning for retirement, Oink is here to support you every step of the way. Our user-friendly platform and expert resources are designed to demystify finance and empower you to take control of your financial well-being.

Lastly, we believe that financial freedom is within reach for everyone. Join us on this journey towards financial stability and independence, and together, let's build a brighter financial future for all.



## What it does:
This free online platform provides free financial resources in areas, such as budgeting, saving, investing, and/or filing taxes by connecting people with industry professionals/experts on those topics. We hope the connection and knowledge-sharing enable users to make informed decisions and take proactive steps towards their financial goals.
